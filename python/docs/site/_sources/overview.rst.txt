Pose Wrangler Overview
=========================================

Pose Wrangler is the Maya portion of Pose Driver Connect, a pipeline for creating RBF data for Pose Driver nodes in Unreal leveraging the MayaUERBFPlugin.
The tool provides a way to author secondary animation in Maya through the use of RBF solvers, that can be exported to Unreal in a few clicks, providing a one to one match between Maya and Unreal.

UI Overview

    :alt: UI Overview


1) Solver View
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Here is where you can find a list of all the RBF solvers currently available in the scene and can edit, create, delete
or mirror solvers.

In order to make changes to the poses, drivers or driven transforms/blendshapes you need to toggle a solver into `edit`
mode via the `Edit Selected Solver` button.

.. note::

    Only one solver can be edited at a single time.

2) Pose View
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Here you can find a list of all the poses. In order to make any changes to the poses, you need to edit the corresponding solver.

.. warning::

    Most of these are self-explanatory, but is it worth noting that `Mute Pose` will enable and disable the pose on the
    solver via the `targetEnable` attribute. This means that if the RBF solver node is set to use `automatic radius`
    then the radius will be calculated without the influence of the muted poses.


3) Driver View
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.0.0 supports multiple drivers. Here you can add/remove driver transforms.


4) Driven Transforms / Blendshape View
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here you can add/remove driven transforms and create/add blendshapes.

.. note::
    The blendshape workflow is currently a work in progress and may change in the future.


5) Extensions and Settings View
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pose Wrangler now supports writing custom extensions for the tool that can be embedded into the UI here.
`Core Extensions` and `Pose Exporter` are default extensions that ship with Pose Wrangler.
For more information on how these extensions work and how to create your own, please refer to the :doc:`extensions`
page.

You can also change the mirror mapping, which will allow you to specify a custom mapping if your skeleton does not
match the default MetaHuman skeleton and the mirror solver/pose functionality is causing unexpected results.

6) Top Menu
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here you can import/export RBF solvers to/from a JSON file, change the theme and view the help.


7) Output Log
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Displays debug, info, warning and error messages.
