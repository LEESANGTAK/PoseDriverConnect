Release History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


2.3.0:
++++++++++++++++

    - Maya 2020-2024 Support

    New skeleton config file:
        - Replaces the existing mirror mapping file, encompassing that data and enabling additional skeleton related data to be stored and customized.
        - New retargeting feature to support driver/bind skeleton setups.

    New serialization interface
        - New serializers can be made as the tool matures, ensuring backwards compatibility and upgrade steps for previous versions
        - All current saved files prior to this update will use the 1.0.0 serializer and automatically be upgraded to 1.1.0 upon next save.
        - 1.1.0 introduces a new `metadata` field and stores the solver data under a new `solvers` field

    New Pose Exporter:
        - Pose Wrangler now ships with the Pose Exporter extension, a simple to use interface that handles the exporting of poses and solver data into a format that the Unreal Pose Driver Connect plugin can interpret.
        - Pose Wrangler must be on your `PYTHONPATH` in order for the exporter to work, otherwise the export will fail with the exporter unable to find `epic_pose_wrangler`
        - Pose Exporter exports out each solver's poses as an FBX animation sequence, that Pose Driver Connect in Unreal can use to generate AnimSequences and PoseAssets.


2.0.0:
++++++++++++++++

   - Supports scenes created with the UERBFSolverNode
   - Multiple Driver Support
   - Initial blendshape support (WIP)
   - Supports Maya 2018-2022
   - Support for custom mirror mappings to allow for rigs with naming conventions that deviate from the default UE5 conventions
   - Fully automatable via Python and MayaPy
   - Serialization/deserialization to dictionary or JSON file
   - Support for custom extensions and context menu actions

1.0.0:
++++++++++++++++

   - Provides upgrade workflow to migrate to V2
